# Calliope

Calliope is a small set of opinionated DDD Seedwork classes that helps enable durable, long-lasting software architectures.

## Why the name?

In Greek mythology, Calliope was the Muse that presided over eloquence and epic poetry.  Seemed fitting.

## Who is this intended for?

Right now, only me.  You can use it if you want, but for now it should be considered unstable and will potentially change unannounced.  If I ever get it to a point where I'm happy with it that might change.
